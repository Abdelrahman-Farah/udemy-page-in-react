The theme of the programs within is collaborative; i.e. writing code intended to be easily understood, inherited, encapsulated, and/or overridden by another programmer-in-league. I found this instrumental in better understanding objects and instances, and even built-ins and their attributes. The assignments start off a little easy, but by the end you are building custom exceptions and writing tests for your scripts. Highly recommend for those that have made it through one or several Python tutorials (I started with Learn Python the Hard Way) and looking to better understand classes and what OOP is all about."

          "\"Inspired\" - This is an inspiring course taught by an inspired teacher. The examples are well-chosen -- demonstrating principles through engaging, colorful projects rather than by teaching abstract principles first. While I wish the instructor weren't quite so repetitiously exuberant, this is at worst a minor stylistic blemish and might even be a plus for kids viewing it. — Kent Osband, Udemy student",

Instead, the course heavily focuses on different problems, but the technical aspect is very lacking. It's more like a coding exercise which scratches on the surface of Data Structures and Algorithms. As for the Interview sections, even though I had fun from it, it isn't useful or helpful."

This course provided various practical examples and suggested libraries for achieving those tasks.

I tried to build the file transfer portion but it seems there is very different ways of coding this from 2.7 to 3.6. I'd like to thank the instructor for updating the class using the latest python, everything has been going smoothly & any questions i have regarding some the lessons in which we had to figure out how to add certain functions were answered i such a fashion that I understood which direction i needed to go instead of outright giving the answer. Which further helps in building confidence that I am learning & understanding the lessons."

I really recommend this course.\n\nThe reason why I gave 4.5 stars is some concepts were just rushed quickly as I understood what Jose was doing but didn't really understand the logic behind so had to do lots of google search.\n\nI know If he spent time on explaining every logic behind each line course would never finish.\n\nAlso I wish OOP lectures had more exercises just like Methods and Functions.\n\nBefore taking this course If you feel like you want to go to course and you dont want to study online, I wouldn't really recommend that.Because the best part of this course was whatever I couldn't find online or couldn't understand It was either asked or Jose's teachers were responding my questions immidiately."

(The Whole Topic)\n\n- Within a a while loop or an if statements > continue to skip that iteration.\n\n- I have passed both exams and have wrote some code of my own but still I find it very difficult to think my way through complicated multi levels while or for loops which is how the you get tested.

I wrote detailed notes for each lesson for the first half of the course before I decided to explore the lesson notebooks. For the second half of the course I just duplicated the lesson notebooks and added some additional notes of my own to those which allowed me to proceed through the course quicker. The notebooks were a wonderful addition to this course to reinforce information learned during the lectures. Overall it was a great learning experience, thanks Jose. If I would suggest one thing, it would be to add a section at the very end of the course that shows a complete roadmap of learning programming. This type of roadmap could showcase the portions of the learning journey that we explored and the portions that we have not explored. This way students can get an idea of where they should head next to continue their studies after completing this course. Highly recommend!"

I graduated in 2013 with a Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies from the University of Muenster in Germany with a focus on using Python for remote sensing.\n\nI have worked with companies from various countries, such as the Center for Conservation Geography, to map and understand Australian ecosystems, image processing with the Swiss in-Terra, and performing data mining to gain business insights with the Australian Rapid Intelligence.\n\nIf you want to learn Python through my courses, I propose the following learning path: Start with The Python Mega Course 2022: Build 10 Real-World Applications. Students love that course as a comprehensive real-world guide to Python and building programs with Python. After finishing that course, take my Automate Everything with Python course if you want to use Python to make small-to-medium programs. That course contains everything you need to start using Python as your swiss army knife. On the other hand, if you are interested in making large applications, my advanced course Advanced Python: Python OOP with 10 Real-World Programs would be a better choice. All the courses are listed here on my Udemy profile page.\n\nShow more"

I will guide you step by step, starting from the basics and always assuming you don't have previous programming experience or a computer science degree. In fact, most people who learn Python come from a wide variety of careers.",
          "This course is designed to teach you Python and give you a real feel of how to use Python in a real environment. You will get this real-world Python experience by gaining free access to a remote server where Python is already installed. You will write and run Python programs directly on that remote computer in an easy fashion by simply using your internet browser. This will also allow you to run Python programs 24/7 on that server and let the apps do interesting tasks while you sleep. That will make you understand Python's real power in a real server environment, and I will guide you through the entire process.",
          "The course is ideal for those who haven't programmed before. It also works for experienced programmers who don't know Python because the course offers you a training package so dense with information and practical activities you will not need to look further.",
          "Besides videos, you will also find a lot of Python exercises in the course. These are interactive exercises that you can solve directly on the Udemy exercise interface. The course also contains quizzes that will help you constantly check the knowledge you get during the videos. This variety of learning material will help you solidify your Python skills and give you a fun learning experience.",
          "This course has all you need to get you started. After you take it, you will be ready to go to the next level of specializing in one of the Python fields, such as data science or web development. Python is one of the most needed skills nowadays. Sign up today!"

Obviously a lot of hard work has gone into creating the content so you learn what's important and are reassured about all the periphery stuff which isn't at the heart of the topic you are learning. Even then there is enough information about other topics to make you aware what other courses may be available so you are free to take your own direction. The pace of the course is efficient which keeps you interested but not totally overwhelming so you can't keep up.
